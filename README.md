# Analysis of Advertisements: A Guide for Non-Technical Stakeholders and Investors

# Overview
- The project aims to understand the underlying themes, societal norms, and sentiments portrayed in various advertisements. The analysis is broken down into several key stages.


# Step 1: What Are We Studying?
**Introduction**
- *Goal: To study the text in different advertisements and analyze what it says about cultural norms, societal views, and more.*
- *Why It Matters: Understanding these aspects can inform better advertising strategies, brand positioning, and customer engagement.*


# Step 2: Where Does the Data Come From?
**Data Collection**
- *Goal: To gather the text from various advertisements.*
- *How We Do It: For this demonstration, we created a sample set of four advertisements with their text. In a real-world scenario, this could be collected from websites, social media, or other platforms.*


# Step 3: Making the Data Ready for Analysis
**Data Preprocessing**
- *Goal: To clean the text and prepare it for analysis.*
- *How We Do It: We remove any special characters and convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.*


# Step 4: What Does the Data Look Like?
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- *Goal: To get an initial understanding of the text data.*
- *How We Do It: We generate a 'Word Cloud,' which visually represents the most frequently occurring words in the text.*


# Step 5: What Does the Text Tell Us?
**Text Analysis**
- *Goal: To understand the sentiments and subjectivity in the text.*
- *How We Do It: We use a technique called 'Sentiment Analysis' to measure how positive, negative, or neutral the text is. We also measure how opinionated the text is.*


# Step 6: Answering the Big Questions
**Answering Research Questions**
- *Goal: To use the analysis to answer specific research questions.*
- *What We Found: The advertisements generally have a neutral to mildly positive tone. They vary in how opinionated they are.*


# Step 7: What Did We Learn?
**Conclusions**
- *Summary: The advertisements are generally neutral to mildly positive and vary in how opinionated they are.*
- *Implications: This information can be useful for brand positioning and understanding how an advertisement might be received by the public.*


# Step 8: Whatâ€™s Next?
**Future Work**
- *Goal: To build upon this initial analysis for more comprehensive insights.*
- *How We Do It: By using a larger dataset and more advanced techniques, we can delve deeper into understanding the nuances in advertisements.*
